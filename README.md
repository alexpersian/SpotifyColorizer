#  Spotify Colorizer

This project was created as an effort to replicate the [Colorizer](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_identity_for_spotify_by_collins.php) effect that Spotify uses throught their brand imagery. It was also a good way to get more comfortable with building an app using Objective-C instead of Swift.
