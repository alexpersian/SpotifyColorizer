#  Spotify Colorizer

This project was created as an effort to replicate the [Colorizer](https://medium.com/@pierrellev/reproduce-colorizer-effect-of-spotify-71d5de88039f) effect that Spotify uses throught their brand imagery. It was also a good way to get more comfortable with building an app using Objective-C instead of Swift.
